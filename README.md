# Manufacturing Dashboard Project

A comprehensive Power BI dashboard project designed to monitor and improve manufacturing processes, including production performance, quality control, inventory management, operational efficiency, supplier performance, and workforce productivity. 

## Project Objective
The objective of this dashboard project is to:
- Provide real-time insights into critical manufacturing metrics.
- Enable data-driven decision-making to enhance productivity, reduce costs, and optimize resources.
- Support efficient tracking of key performance indicators (KPIs) across the production lifecycle.

## Key Dashboards

1. **Production Performance Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Units Manufactured, Production Cost, Production Efficiency, On-Time Delivery
   - **Purpose**: Tracks manufacturing performance and cost trends to ensure productivity goals.

2. **Quality Control Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Defect Rate, Return Rate, First Pass Yield
   - **Purpose**: Monitors product quality to reduce defects and returns, helping maintain high standards.

3. **Inventory Management Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Stock Levels, Inventory Cost, Overstock & Stockout Rates
   - **Purpose**: Ensures optimal stock levels, minimizing both overstock and stockout occurrences.

4. **Operational Efficiency Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), Scrap Rate, Changeover Time, Cycle Time
   - **Purpose**: Assesses machinery performance and identifies areas to reduce waste and improve cycle time.

5. **Maintenance & Downtime Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Downtime, MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures), MTTR (Mean Time to Repair)
   - **Purpose**: Tracks machine maintenance and failure rates to reduce downtime.

6. **Supplier Performance Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Lead Time, Defect Rate, On-Time Delivery, Order Fulfillment
   - **Purpose**: Measures supplier reliability and efficiency in meeting manufacturing requirements.

7. **Workforce Productivity Dashboard**
   - **Metrics**: Productivity Rate, Utilization Rate, Overtime Hours, Labor Cost
   - **Purpose**: Analyzes workforce efficiency and labor costs for productivity optimization.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI** for dashboard creation and data visualization.
- **Python** and **pandas** (if applicable) for data preprocessing.
- **SQL** for data extraction and transformation (if applicable).
